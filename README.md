## 📂 Featured Projects
Here are some of the projects I’m most proud of:  
1. 💳 **[Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Sharma-Ayush/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)** 
    - Designed, developed, and deployed an end-to-end Flask web application, hosted on AWS Cloud leveraging GitHub Actions, AWS ECR, and AWS App Runner.
    - Achieved an 81.6% Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (PR-AUC) in identifying fraudulent transactions.
    - Enhanced the performance of a Decision Tree model by 24.45% through exploratory data analysis (EDA), class imbalance handling, feature selection, and advanced feature engineering techniques.
    - Utilized Git and GitHub for efficient version control and Docker for streamlined containerization. 
    - Analyzed feature importance, precision-recall curve, and decision tree graphs to interpret model behavior.

2. 💳 **[Credit Score Bracket Classification](https://github.com/Sharma-Ayush/Credit-Score-Bracket-Classifier)**  
    - Attained 66.3% F1 Macro Score in predicting customer credit score brackets.
    - Trained, tuned, and compared tree-based models, boosting algorithms, and voting algorithms for a multi-class classification problem. 
    - Executed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and handled missing values using the dataset's chronological order; applied IQR and median standardization for outlier detection.
    - Applied statistical tests for feature selection, addressed class imbalance, analyzed feature importance, and generated preprocessing pipelines.

3. ❤️ **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/Sharma-Ayush/Heart-Disease-Detector)**  
    - Attained 86.4% F1 Score in predicting heart disease using a logistic regression model.
    - Performed EDA to identify polynomial and categorical interaction terms that suitably modeled decision boundaries, improving model performance.
    - Mitigated overfitting through techniques like learning curves, regularization, and bagging classifiers.
    - Optimized the model’s probability threshold using ROC curves to balance recall and False Positive Rate (FPR).

4. ✈️ **[Flight Booking Price Prediction](https://github.com/Sharma-Ayush/Flight-Booking-Price-Predictor)**  
    - Achieved a 98.3% R² on the test set, demonstrating high model accuracy.
    - Evaluated and compared regression-based ML algorithms, including linear regression, tree-based models, and deep learning techniques.
    - Performed detailed EDA and engineered polynomial and categorical features, improving the linear regression model’s performance by 29% for economy class and 42% for business class, and achieving 96.2% R² on the full test dataset.
    - Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning via random search and cross-validation.
    - Developed feature transformation pipelines for seamless deployment.
    - Analyzed feature importance and measured cyclical vs ordinal encoding impact on model performance.
